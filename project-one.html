										<p>As a seasoned Project Manager, I have orchestrated numerous high-impact initiatives that have significantly contributed to organizational success and client satisfaction. Notably, I led the modernization of a Rewards Redemption Program, overseeing 34 projects and effectively managing an $18M budget. Through strategic planning and cross-functional collaboration, I ensured project milestones were achieved within the stipulated timeframe of 22 months, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and increased engagement. Furthermore, my role in spearheading the implementation of a cutting-edge Rewards Redemption System for a FinTech client showcased my ability to manage complex projects, deliverables, and client expectations with meticulous attention to detail, resulting in a seamless transition and an enriched customer experience.</p>
										<p>In addition to project management excellence, I have played a pivotal role in fortifying organizational defenses through the orchestration of comprehensive Cybersecurity Programs. By overseeing intricate workstreams and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams and external vendors, I successfully executed initiatives such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) uplift and Privileged Access Management (PAM), resulting in strengthened cybersecurity posture and mitigated risks across the organization. Moreover, my contributions to business integration initiatives with the bank underscore my proficiency in vendor management, compliance adherence, and process optimization, all of which have facilitated seamless transitions and operational effectiveness. Within the PMO domain, I have spearheaded various initiatives, including the development of onboarding processes for new project managers, budget forecasting, and the implementation of dynamic dashboards, all aimed at fostering a culture of productivity, efficiency, and informed decision-making across projects and initiatives.</p>
